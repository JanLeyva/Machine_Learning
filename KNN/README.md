# K-Nearest-Neighbor Regression

This small piece of code show how to implement the `KNN` regression in R. The function is a extension of `KNN` for do a regression following the same 
dynamic than simple `KNN` but evaluating each *t* point and finding his nearest neighbors in order to fit a regression.
The interesting think abouth this is how as long we choose a big **K** the regression is more generalizated and if the **K** is small the overfitting for nearest points is huge.
